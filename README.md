# Password-generator


Overview:
The Random Password Generator is a Python program designed to generate secure and customizable passwords based on user-defined criteria. By leveraging the random and string modules in Python, the program produces strong passwords with varying lengths and character compositions.

Features:

Customizable Length: Users can specify the minimum length for the generated password, ensuring flexibility to meet specific security requirements.
Inclusion of Numbers and Special Characters: The program allows users to include numbers and special characters in the generated password, enhancing its complexity and resistance to brute-force attacks.
User Interaction: Through simple user prompts, users can input their preferences for password length, inclusion of numbers, and inclusion of special characters, ensuring tailored password generation.
Secure Generation: Passwords are generated using a secure and randomized approach, guaranteeing unpredictability and resilience against common password guessing techniques.
Feedback Mechanism: The program provides users with feedback on the generated password, displaying the final result for immediate use.
Usage:

Input Minimum Length: Users are prompted to enter the desired minimum length for the generated password.
Specify Number Inclusion: Users are asked whether they want to include numbers in the password (Y/N).
Specify Special Character Inclusion: Users are prompted to specify if they want to include special characters in the password (Y/N).
Password Generation: Based on user input, the program generates a password that meets the specified criteria.
Display Generated Password: The program outputs the generated password for immediate use.
